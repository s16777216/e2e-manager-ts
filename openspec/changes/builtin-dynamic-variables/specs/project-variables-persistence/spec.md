## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Save block-level changes independently without data loss
The system SHALL save settings for individual configuration blocks (General, Storage, Variables) independently, and MUST NOT overwrite or clear variables or storage details when other blocks are modified and saved.

The system's interpolation engine MUST accept an optional `RunContext` parameter on both `interpolateString` and `interpolateObject`. When no `RunContext` is supplied (existing callers), the behaviour is identical to the current implementation — builtin functions without a snapshot key still execute but produce a new value each time.

#### Scenario: Save general settings does not erase variables
- **WHEN** the user saves name or description changes in the General block
- **THEN** the system persists those details, and the environment variables in the database remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Existing interpolation callers without RunContext still work
- **WHEN** `interpolateString` is called without a `context` argument (legacy call site)
- **THEN** static variable substitution behaves exactly as before; any `{{$fn()}}` patterns in the template are evaluated fresh each time (no snapshot caching)
